# openGL project1
kind of the first actual app we wrote in c++ which is a huge mess and we stopped working on because we got bored since openGL produces too much driver overhead
which is not suitable for writing grounded software and we are using Vulkan instead now.
Nonetheless you got some useful concepts implemented like procedural model generation or some basic shading techniques.
